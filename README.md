# bscores
An R implementation for calculating [B-scores](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-022-04594-7), a method for predicting the outcome of pairwise comparisons of agents based on the eigenvector centrality.

>  In this framework, every new match serves to update the full network, rather than
only the ratings of the players involved.
